dhfun2 - Reading DAQ-HDF5 files with MATLAB's HDF5 library
==========================================================

dhfun2 is a drop-in replacement for dhfun that does not use the mex function `dhfun`, but
instead relies on MATLAB's built-in HDF5 functionality. It's currently work-in-progress
to see if it's feasible and worth building.
